        Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Just beat the devil out of it. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.

        I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. A happy cloud. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.
